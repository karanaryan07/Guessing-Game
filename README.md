# Guessing-Game
A program that picks a random integer from the given range, and the player has to guess the number.

#Rules

## 1. If a player's guess is less than or greater than the range, it will say "OUT OF BOUNDS"

## 2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is
   ###within 10 of the number, output will be "WARM!"
   ###further than 10 away from the number, output will be "COLD!"
   
## 3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
   ###closer to the number than the previous guess output will be "WARMER!"
   ###farther from the number than the previous guess, output will be "COLDER!"
   
## 4. When the player's guess equals the number, it will tell them how many guesses they took!
